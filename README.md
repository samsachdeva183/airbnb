Exploring and Analyzing Airbnb Listing in Toronto, Canada


Inside Airbnb(http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) is a website that utilizes public information compiled from the Airbnb web-site and analyzes publicly available information about a city’s Airbnb’s listings, and provides filters and key metrics so we can see how Airbnb is being used in the major cities around the world.

I worked with the Toronto data here as I will be moving to Toronto soon, so I thought it would be interesting.
It had one year worth of data from Dec 2019 to Dec 2020

I did exploratory data analysis and tried to answer some questions like:

1. Which months are busiest and which are not to visit Toronto?
2. Which months are most expensive and least expensive to visit Toronto?
3. Which days of week are most busy and least busy to visit Toronto?
4. Which days of week are most expensive and least expensive to visit Toronto?
5. Which neighborhoods has the most and the least expensive listings?
6. How does the average price of the houses compare with the number of reviews received?


I also built a regression model to predict prices and got a R2 score of 73% on the test data.
